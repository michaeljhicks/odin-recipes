    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 F. Toss cherry tomatoes, sliced in half, with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and minced garlic. Spread
        in a casserole dish. Roast for about 20 minutes while you prepare the pasta.</li>
        <li>Prepare the chicken. This recipe uses 1.5 lb of chicken breasts which usually means 2 large chicken breasts. Make sure
        to use thinly sliced chicken breasts. Slice each chicken breast in half horizontally. Season them with salt, pepper, and
        paprika.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil on medium-high heat in a large skillet until hot. Add chicken and cook for about 5
        minutes per each side until it's cooked through. Remove chicken to a plate. Slice it thinly.</li>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to boil. Cook pasta according to package instructions. Drain.</li>
        <li>Add cooked and drained pasta, basil pesto, and cream to the same skillet that you used to sear chicken. Stir gently and
        bring to simmer to coat pasta with sauce.</li>
        <li>Top with sliced cooked chicken, roasted tomatoes and pine nuts (optional). Season with extra salt and pepper or add
        crushed red pepper flakes, if desired.</li>
    </ol>

        <li><strong>Add extra toppings. </strong>Lightly toasted pine nuts and freshly grated Parmesan cheese add extra flavor and texture.</li>

        <li><strong>Add spiciness. </strong>Add red pepper flakes if you would like to make your pasta spicy.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust seasonings. </strong>Even though the basil pesto tends to be salty, do taste the final dish before serving and season it with extra salt and
        pepper, if needed.</li>
